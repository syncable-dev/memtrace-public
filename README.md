Memtrace gives coding agents something they've never had: **structural memory**. Not vector similarity. Not semantic chunking. A real knowledge graph compiled from your codebase's AST — where every function, class, interface, and API endpoint exists as a node with deterministic, typed relationships.

Index once. Every agent query after that resolves through graph traversal — callers, callees, implementations, imports, blast radius, temporal evolution — in milliseconds, with zero token waste.

```bash
npm install -g memtrace    # binary + 12 skills + MCP server — one command
memtrace start             # launches the graph database
memtrace index .           # indexes your codebase in seconds
```

That's it. Claude picks up the skills and MCP tools automatically.

## Why Memtrace Exists

Good code intelligence tools already exist. GitNexus and CodeGrapherContext build AST-based graphs with symbol relationships, and they work well for understanding what's in your codebase *right now*.

Memtrace is a **bi-temporal episodic structural knowledge graph**. It builds on that same AST foundation and adds two dimensions:

- **Temporal memory** — every symbol carries its full version history. Agents can reason about *what changed*, *when it changed*, and *how the architecture evolved* — not just what exists today. Six scoring algorithms (impact, novelty, recency, directional, compound, overview) let agents ask different temporal questions.
- **Cross-service API topology** — Memtrace maps HTTP call graphs between repositories, detecting which services call which endpoints across your architecture.

On top of that, the structural layer is comprehensive:

- **Symbols are nodes** — functions, classes, interfaces, types, endpoints
- **Relationships are edges** — `CALLS`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `IMPORTS`, `EXPORTS`, `CONTAINS`
- **Community detection** — Louvain algorithm identifies architectural modules automatically
- **Hybrid search** — Tantivy BM25 + vector embeddings + Reciprocal Rank Fusion, all on top of the graph
- **Rust-native** — compiled binary, no Python/JS runtime overhead, sub-15ms average query latency

The agent doesn't just search your code. It *remembers* it.

## Benchmarks

All benchmarks run on the same machine, same codebase, same queries. No cherry-picking.

<details>
<summary><strong>Memtrace vs. general memory systems (Mem0, Graphiti)</strong></summary>

<br/>

Mem0 and Graphiti are strong conversational memory engines designed for tracking entity knowledge (e.g. `User -> Likes -> Apples`). They excel at that. For code intelligence specifically, the tradeoff is that they rely on LLM inference to build their graphs — which adds cost and time when processing thousands of source files.

**Graphiti** processes data through `add_episode()`, which triggers multiple LLM calls per episode — entity extraction, relationship resolution, deduplication. At ~50 episodes/minute ([source](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti)), ingesting 1,500 code files takes **1–2 hours**.

**Mem0** processes data through `client.add()`, which queues async LLM extraction and conflict resolution per memory item ([source](https://mem0.ai)). Bulk ingestion with `infer=True` (default) means every file passes through an LLM pipeline. Throughput is bounded by your LLM provider's rate limits.

**Both** accumulate $10–50+ in API costs for large codebases because every relationship is inferred rather than parsed.

**Memtrace takes a different approach:** it indexes 1,500 files in 1.2–1.8 seconds for $0.00 — no LLM calls, no API costs, no rate limits. Native Tree-sitter AST parsers resolve deterministic symbol references (`CALLS`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `IMPORTS`) locally. The tradeoff is that Memtrace is purpose-built for code — it doesn't handle conversational entity memory the way Mem0 and Graphiti do.

<summary><strong>Memtrace vs. code graphers (GitNexus, CodeGrapherContext)</strong></summary>

<br/>

GitNexus and CodeGrapherContext both build AST-based code graphs with structural relationships — solid tools in the same space. Memtrace shares that foundation and extends it with temporal memory, API topology, and a Rust runtime:

| Capability | Memtrace | GitNexus | CodeGrapher |
|:-----------|:---------|:---------|:------------|
| AST-based graph | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Structural relationships (CALLS, IMPLEMENTS, IMPORTS) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Bi-temporal version history per symbol | **Yes — 6 scoring modes** | Git-diff only | No |
| Cross-service HTTP API topology | **Yes** | No | No |
| Community detection (Louvain) | **Yes** | Yes | No |
| Hybrid search (BM25 + vector + RRF) | **Yes — Tantivy + embeddings** | No | BM25 + optional embeddings |
| Language | **Rust (compiled binary)** | JavaScript | Python |
| Search accuracy (1K queries) | **97.3%** | 12.8% | 0%* |
| Query latency (1K queries) | **13.4 ms avg** | 172.7 ms avg | 510.5 ms avg |
| Tokens per query | **319 avg** | 254 avg | 23 avg |
| Index time (1,500 files) | **1.5 sec** | 10.5 sec | ~3.5 min |

*CGC's 0% reflects an output format mismatch — it returns symbol names without file paths, so our Acc@1 evaluator can't match them. CGC likely finds relevant symbols; the metric just can't confirm it. All numbers from [live benchmark](benchmarks/) on the same machine, same codebase, same 1,000 queries.

The latency difference is primarily Rust vs. interpreted runtimes, and Memgraph's Bolt protocol vs. HTTP/embedding pipelines. The feature difference is temporal memory and API topology — dimensions Memtrace adds on top of the shared AST-graph foundation.

## 12 Agent Skills

Memtrace ships skills that teach Claude *how* to use the graph. They fire automatically based on what you ask — no prompt engineering required.

| | Skill | You say... |
|:--|:------|:-----------|
| **Search** | `memtrace-search` | _"find this function"_, _"where is X defined"_ |
| **Relationships** | `memtrace-relationships` | _"who calls this"_, _"show class hierarchy"_ |
| **Evolution** | `memtrace-evolution` | _"what changed this week"_, _"how did this evolve"_ |
| **Impact** | `memtrace-impact` | _"what breaks if I change this"_, _"blast radius"_ |
| **Quality** | `memtrace-quality` | _"find dead code"_, _"complexity hotspots"_ |
| **Architecture** | `memtrace-graph` | _"show me the architecture"_, _"find bottlenecks"_ |
| **APIs** | `memtrace-api-topology` | _"list API endpoints"_, _"service dependencies"_ |
| **Index** | `memtrace-index` | _"index this project"_, _"parse this codebase"_ |

Plus **4 workflow skills** that chain multiple tools with decision logic:

| Skill | You say... |
|:------|:-----------|
| `memtrace-codebase-exploration` | _"I'm new to this project"_, _"give me an overview"_ |
| `memtrace-change-impact-analysis` | _"what will break if I refactor this"_ |
| `memtrace-incident-investigation` | _"something broke"_, _"root cause analysis"_ |
| `memtrace-refactoring-guide` | _"help me refactor"_, _"clean up tech debt"_ |

## Temporal Engine

Six scoring algorithms for different temporal questions:

| Mode | Best for |
|:-----|:---------|
| **`compound`** | General-purpose _"what changed?"_ — weighted blend of impact, novelty, recency |
| **`impact`** | _"What broke?"_ — ranks by blast radius (`in_degree^0.7 × (1 + out_degree)^0.3`) |
| **`novel`** | _"What's unexpected?"_ — anomaly detection via surprise scoring |
| **`recent`** | _"What changed near the incident?"_ — exponential time decay |
| **`directional`** | _"What was added vs removed?"_ — asymmetric scoring |
| **`overview`** | Quick module-level summary |

Uses **Structural Significance Budgeting** to surface the minimum set of changes covering ≥80% of total significance.

## Compatibility

| Editor / Agent | MCP Tools (25+) | Skills (12) | Install |
|:---------------|:---------------:|:-----------:|:--------|
| **Claude Code** | ✅ | ✅ | `npm install -g memtrace` — fully automatic |
| **Claude Desktop** | ✅ | ✅ | Automatic — shared with Claude Code |
| **Cursor** (v2.4+) | ✅ | ✅ | `npm install -g memtrace` — fully automatic |
| **Windsurf** | ✅ | Coming soon | Add MCP server manually |
| **VS Code (Copilot)** | ✅ | — | Add MCP server manually |
| **Cline / Roo Code** | ✅ | — | Add MCP server manually |
| **Codex CLI** | ✅ | Coming soon | Add MCP server manually |
| **Any MCP client** | ✅ | — | Add MCP server manually |

> **MCP tools** work with any editor or agent that supports the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). **Skills** are workflow prompts that teach the agent *how* to chain tools — Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and Cursor (v2.4+) all load them natively from the same `SKILL.md` format.

## Setup

### Claude Code + Claude Desktop

`npm install -g memtrace` handles everything automatically — binary, 12 skills, MCP server, plugin, and marketplace all register in one command for both Claude Code and Claude Desktop.

For manual setup:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add syncable-dev/memtrace
claude plugin install memtrace-skills@memtrace --scope user
claude mcp add memtrace -- memtrace mcp -e MEMGRAPH_URL=bolt://localhost:7687
```

### Cursor

Cursor **v2.4+** supports Agent Skills natively, and `npm install -g memtrace` handles everything automatically — no separate Cursor plugin is needed because Cursor reads the same `SKILL.md` format as Claude.

What the installer writes:
- **MCP server** → `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global — works in every project you open)
- **12 skills + 4 workflows** → `~/.cursor/skills/memtrace-*/SKILL.md`

For a **project-local** install (so the skills travel with your repo and teammates get them on clone), run inside the project:

```bash
memtrace install --only cursor --local
```

This writes to `.cursor/mcp.json` and `.cursor/skills/` relative to the project root instead of your home directory.

For a **manual install** (without the npm package), clone this repo and copy the skills directly:

```bash
cp -R plugins/memtrace-skills/skills/* ~/.cursor/skills/
```

Then register the MCP server manually (see the "Other Editors" JSON below).

### Other Editors (Windsurf, VS Code, Cline)

After `npm install -g memtrace`, add the MCP server to your editor's config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memtrace": {
      "command": "memtrace",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": { "MEMGRAPH_URL": "bolt://localhost:7687" }
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary>Config file locations by editor</summary>

| Editor | Config file |
|:-------|:------------|
| **Windsurf** | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` |
| **VS Code (Copilot)** | `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project root |
| **Cline** | Cline MCP settings in the extension panel |

</details>

### Uninstall

```bash
memtrace uninstall              # removes skills, MCP server, plugin, and settings
npm uninstall -g memtrace       # removes the binary
```

Already ran `npm uninstall` first? The cleanup script is persisted at `~/.memtrace/uninstall.js`:

```bash
node ~/.memtrace/uninstall.js
```
